> To rust unburnish'd, not to shine in use!  
> As tho' to breathe were life. Life piled on life  
> Were all too little, and of one to me  
> Little remains: but every hour is saved  
> From that eternal silence, something more,  
> A bringer of new things; and vile it were  
> For some three suns to store and hoard myself,  
> And this gray spirit yearning in desire  
> To follow knowledge like a sinking star,  
> Beyond the utmost bound of human thought.

spaces to the end of the line to keep the new line.  This was not
obvious to me and took a bit of searching to find the correct syntax.
